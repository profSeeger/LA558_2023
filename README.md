[**What data can help us estimate building heights at high resolution?**](https://xinyan127.github.io/LA558_XinYan/?locale=en-us)<br>
Building height is an important indicator for estimating energy consumption, material stock allocation, greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat island effects, distribution of population,and urban development plan. However, openly accessible building height information over large areas at high spatial resolution is still missing. To estimate the building height at a high accuracy, satellite data is the best choice to do that. Besides that, the building morphology also plays a big role. Different satellite data has various band setting, observation characteristics and research focus, the most important work is finding a set of stable features that help us build a model to estimate the building height. After having these features, we can easily predict the building height!
