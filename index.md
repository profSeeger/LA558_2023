### Introduction
This repository includes the course materials for this [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu) course taught by [Professor Seeger](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/cjseeger/).

This course explores the use and development of online mapping tools and coding to support participatory GIS, Volunteered Geographic Information, data wrangling and sharing, geodesign, and decision-making actions. Geoprocessing, spatial data science, and user interface design. Laboratory emphasis on practical applications and uses of Web GIS.

### Final projects

**Abiola Adesanya - [Developing a Web-Based Historic Places Map: A Tool for Promoting Historic Preservation
and Tourism](https://abiolaaminat.github.io/LA558_Abiola_Adesanya/Finalproject/finalproject.html)**<br>
Historic landmarks and monuments are an important part of our cultural heritage, but
they can be difficult to discover and learn about. To promote historic preservation and tourism,
there is a need for tools that help people discover and explore historic places in their communities.
This project aims to develop a web-based historic places map that provides users with a visual
representation of the historic landmarks and monuments in Iowa State. The map will be created
using data from historic preservation organizations, government agencies, and museums. The tool
will allow users to explore and interact with data, including photographs. The goal of this project
is to promote historic preservation, tourism, and education by providing an interactive tool for
discovering and learning about historic places in Iowa State.


**Xin Yan - [What data can help us estimate building heights at high resolution?](https://xinyan127.github.io/LA558_XinYan/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Building height is an important indicator for estimating energy consumption, material stock allocation, greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat island effects, distribution of population,and urban development plan. However, openly accessible building height information over large areas at high spatial resolution is still missing. To estimate the building height at a high accuracy, satellite data is the best choice to do that. Besides that, the building morphology also plays a big role. Different satellite data has various band setting, observation characteristics and research focus, the most important work is finding a set of stable features that help us build a model to estimate the building height. After having these features, we can easily predict the building height!
